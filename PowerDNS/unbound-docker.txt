Override default forward
By default, forwarders are configured to use Cloudflare DNS. You can retrieve the configuration in the forward-records.conf file.

You can create your own configuration file and override the one placed in /opt/unbound/etc/unbound/forward-records.conf in the container.

Example forward-records.conf:

forward-zone:
  # Forward all queries (except those in cache and local zone) to
  # upstream recursive servers
  name: "."

  # my DNS
  forward-addr: 192.168.0.1@53#home.local
Another example forward-records.conf:

forward-zone:
    # Forward all queries (except those in cache and local zone) to
    # upstream recursive servers
    name: "."
    # Queries to this forward zone use TLS
    forward-tls-upstream: yes

    ## CleanBrowsing Family Filter
    forward-addr: 185.228.168.168@853#family-filter-dns.cleanbrowsing.org
    forward-addr: 185.228.169.168@853#family-filter-dns.cleanbrowsing.org
Once the file has your entries in it, mount your version of the file as a volume when starting the container:

docker run \
--name my-unbound \
--detach=true \
--publish=53:53/tcp \
--publish=53:53/udp \
--restart=unless-stopped \
---volume $(pwd)/forward-records.conf:/opt/unbound/etc/unbound/forward-records.conf:ro \

Serve Custom DNS Records for Local Network
While Unbound is not a full authoritative name server, it supports resolving custom entries on a small, private LAN. In other words, you can use Unbound to resolve fake names such as your-computer.local within your LAN.

To support such custom entries using this image, you need to provide an a-records.conf or srv-records.conf file. This conf file is where you will define your custom entries for forward and reverse resolution.

A records
The a-records.conf file should use the following format:

# A Record
  #local-data: "somecomputer.local. A 192.168.1.1"
  local-data: "laptop.local. A 192.168.1.2"

# PTR Record
  #local-data-ptr: "192.168.1.1 somecomputer.local."
  local-data-ptr: "192.168.1.2 laptop.local."
Once the file has your entries in it, mount your version of the file as a volume when starting the container:

docker run \
--name my-unbound \
--detach=true \
--publish=53:53/tcp \
--publish=53:53/udp \
--restart=unless-stopped \
--volume $(pwd)/a-records.conf:/opt/unbound/etc/unbound/a-records.conf:ro \
mvance/unbound:latest
SRV records
The srv-records.conf file should use the following format:

# SRV records
# _service._proto.name. | TTL | class | SRV | priority | weight | port | target.
_etcd-server-ssl._tcp.domain.local.  86400 IN    SRV 0        10     2380 etcd-0.domain.local.
_etcd-server-ssl._tcp.domain.local.  86400 IN    SRV 0        10     2380 etcd-1.domain.local.
_etcd-server-ssl._tcp.domain.local.  86400 IN    SRV 0        10     2380 etcd-2.domain.local.
Run a container that use this SRV config file:

docker run \
--name my-unbound \
--detach=true \
--publish=53:53/tcp \
--publish=53:53/udp \
--restart=unless-stopped \
--volume $(pwd)/srv-records.conf:/opt/unbound/etc/unbound/srv-records.conf:ro \

Use a customized Unbound configuration
Instead of using this image's default configuration for Unbound, you may supply your own configuration. If your customized configuration is located at /my-directory/unbound/unbound.conf, pass /my-directory/unbound as a volume when creating your container:

docker run --name=my-unbound \
--detach=true \
--publish=53:53/tcp \
--publish=53:53/udp \
--restart=unless-stopped \
--volume=/my-directory/unbound:/opt/unbound/etc/unbound/ \
mvance/unbound:latest
This will expose all files in /my-directory/unbound/ to the container. As an alternate way to serve custom DNS records for any local zones, either place them directly in your unbound.conf, or place the local zones in a separate file and use Unbound's include directive within your unbound.conf:

include: /opt/unbound/etc/unbound/local-zone-unbound.conf
Your volume's contents might eventually look something like this:

/my-directory/unbound/
-- unbound.conf
-- local-zone-unbound.conf
-- secret-zone.conf
-- some-other.conf
Overall, this approach is very similar to the a-records.conf approach described above. However, by passing your unbound directory rather than a single file, you have more options for customizing and segmenting your Unbound configuration.

Note: Care has been taken in the image's default configuration to enable security options so it is recommended to use it as a guide.

Run on different port
If you want to run Unbound on a different such as 5353, modify the publish flags:

sudo docker run \
--name=my-unbound \
--publish=5353:53/tcp \
--publish=5353:53/udp \
--detach=true \
--restart=unless-stopped \
--volume=$(pwd)/my-directory/forward-records.conf:/opt/unbound/etc/unbound/forward-records.conf:ro \
--volume=$(pwd)/my-directory/a-records.conf:/opt/unbound/etc/unbound/a-records.conf:ro \
